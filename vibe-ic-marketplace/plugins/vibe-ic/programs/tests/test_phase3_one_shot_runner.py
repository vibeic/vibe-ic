"""Tests for phase3_one_shot_runner.py — Phase 3 (synth → GDS) orchestrator.

Wave 83 — coverage for previously untested orchestrator.

The runner shells out to Yosys / OpenROAD / KLayout inside an vibeic-eda
Docker container. The test environment has no Docker, so we exercise
the orchestrator's control-flow paths only:

  1. POSITIVE_FAIL_MISSING_PROJECT — non-existent project dir → exit 2.
  2. POSITIVE_FAIL_NO_RTL — project exists but rtl/ empty → synth step
                              FAILs (no RTL to synthesise) → exit 1 +
                              report emitted under reports/.
  3. INTEGRATION_REPORT_SHAPE — emitted phase3_one_shot.json must contain
                                  project / pdk / top / steps / verdict.
  4. EDGE_INVALID_PDK_OVERRIDE — `--pdk thispdkdoesnotexist` falls back
                                   to sky130A (current behaviour).
  5. STEPS_INCLUDE_DRC_AND_LVS — even on FAIL the steps array contains
                                   drc + lvs entries (always reported).

#: EVERY test here launches `phase3_one_shot_runner.py`, and that launch does
#: not fit the harness's 180 s item bound reliably. MEASURED: quiet, the six
#: tests are `6 passed in 95.04 s` with a worst single call of 21.04 s; under
#: ordinary fleet contention the SAME call ran past 60 s. So the two numbers
#: this file must declare are different from the defaults:
#:
#:   * the ITEM bound, here: 300 s, a CEILING and not a target, so a slow run
#:     completes or fails on its own instead of taking every other file's
#:     verdict down with it (`--timeout-method=thread` kills the SESSION);
#:   * the INNER bound, `_run` below: 100 s, which `ci_harness_timeout_ceiling_
#:     check` holds to 300 // 3 = 100 s.
#:
#: WHY 300 AND NOT THE 600 THIS LINE USED TO SAY (vibe-ic#1734). 600 was not a
#: bound this file could actually have. TWO clocks run over it, not one:
#:
#:     pytest_per_file_junit.py --stall-after 300   <- the DRIVER. Unmovable
#:                                                     from inside this file.
#:       pytest --timeout=... --timeout-method=thread  <- movable by this mark.
#:
#: A `pytest.mark.timeout(600)` moves the INNER clock to 600 and leaves the
#: outer one at 300. This file emits no progress relay events, so a run that
#: passed 300 s of silence was killed by the DRIVER — before the 600 s mark it
#: declared could ever be reached. The mark did not buy 600 s; it bought 300 s
#: and a false belief about which number was protecting the file. Worse, it
#: bought a raised CEILING for inner bounds on the strength of a budget that
#: did not exist — which is precisely how a 150 s inner call came to look legal.
#: `marker_ceiling` now returns None above 300 for exactly this reason, so a
#: mark can no longer license an inner bound the driver will never honour.
#:
#: WHY `pytestmark` AND NOT A PER-TEST DECORATOR: the bound being declared
#: lives in `_run`, a module-level helper all six tests share. A decorator on
#: one test cannot govern a helper the other five also call; a module-level
#: mark bounds every item in the file, so every call in it really does run
#: inside a 300 s item. Verified rather than assumed --
#: `pytestmark = pytest.mark.timeout(30)` under `--timeout=2
#: --timeout-method=thread` yields `2 passed`, not a killed session.
#:
#: WHY NOT SIMPLY LOWER `_run` TO 60: measured, that is a FALSE RED under
#: contention -- the trade `test_matrix_63x8_census_freshness.py` already
#: refused for the same reason. 100 keeps that headroom AND fits the ceiling;
#: it is the honest number, where 150-under-a-600-mark was not.

# v1.4.62 — these control-flow tests exercise the DEFAULT (`--pdk auto`)
# resolution, which lands on the container's OSS enablement. On a host that has
# a commercial PDK configured, `commercial_pdk_fallback_guard` now REFUSES that
# silent fallback (it would emit VOID sign-off reports under a false PDK
# belief). These tests are about orchestrator control flow, not PDK intent, so
# they acknowledge the OSS fallback explicitly — which also makes them
# deterministic regardless of the host's private commercial-PDK config.

#: 100 s against the 300 s item bound `pytestmark` declares above (ceiling
#: 300 // 3 = 100). The old 90 s was measured against the wrong denominator:
#: it was chosen when the item bound was the harness's 180 s, where 90 s is
#: half the budget and two calls in one test would end the SESSION.
#: Invisible to `ci_harness_timeout_ceiling_check` until vibe-ic#1277 --
#: the bound is a parameter default, which the gate could not read.
#:
#: 100, not the 150 this said before (vibe-ic#1734). 150 was legal only against
#: a 600 s mark the driver never honoured — see the note on `pytestmark`. Against
#: the bound this file really runs under, the ceiling is 100 and 150 was 1.5x
#: over it. MEASURED 2026-08-17: the whole module is 95 s across six launches, so
#: 100 s for ONE launch is roughly six times the observed per-call cost and keeps
#: the contention headroom that the refusal to drop to 60 was protecting.
#:
#: A default argument is the spelling that hid the single largest offender in this
#: tree once before (#1277): the bound left the findings, the advisories AND the
#: readable-bound denominator at the same time, so an over-ceiling call could
#: report as "0 readable bounds / 0 not judged / PASS".
