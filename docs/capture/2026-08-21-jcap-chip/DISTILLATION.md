# jcap-chip, distilled — the thirteen Bucket-A rules as programs that bite

agent `jdistchip` · branch **`capture/jdistchip-chip-path-rules`**, cut from
`81cd5321b` = `origin/main` = v1.11.68. **No version bump. Nothing pushed to
`main`. No baseline written.**

`RESULT.md` in this folder is the CAPTURE; this file is what happened when its
thirteen Bucket-A records were turned into enforcement.

## Outcome

All 13 Bucket-A rows now have both `programs/<rule_name>.py` and
`programs/tests/test_<rule_name>.py`. Twelve were written here; one was found
ALREADY IMPLEMENTED and its record repointed at the real enforcement.

| resolution | rule | note |
|---|---|---|
| already implemented | `emitted_script_portability_check` | `recoveries.json` was repointed from `emitted_script_paths_are_project_relative`. The existing program covers the same population and draws a SHARPER line: a finding is an absolute path INSIDE the run root, while a path outside it names the environment and must not be relativised. A near-duplicate was drafted, swept, and deleted rather than landed beside it. |
| written | the other twelve | one per record |

Every rule is **Bucket A**, including the three the brief flagged as possible
Bucket T. All three are plugin-side emitters: the antenna report is written by
plugin Python `write_text`; the stage stamp is emitted by plugin-generated tcl;
the power header and its session script are both plugin-authored. The tool
supplies numbers, the plugin composes the claims.

## Two true positives, found on first run

* `ip_catalog_reproduce_pull._git_clone_shallow` checked out the pinned commit
  best-effort, swallowed both calls and returned success regardless — so a
  reproducibility verdict about a PINNED COMMIT could be computed against
  whatever the default branch held, with nothing naming the compared revision.
* `_emit_antenna_report` emitted a RESOLVED subject block and, in the same
  write, a typed `Source:` path. Two source claims, one of which can never look
  wrong.

## The finding that outlived the brief: gates that fail open

Each of the twelve was then run against the scenario its RECORD describes, not
the fixture its implementation invites. **Ten fail-open defects and one
over-tight granularity error**, every one returning rc=0 with the defect
present, every one in a gate written to catch that very class of defect:

| gate | it passed on |
|---|---|
| `prepared_checkout_states_the_revision_it_holds` | its own headline case — a stale local ref resolves fine, so the upstream fallback was unreachable. Its test asserted `rc in (0,1,2)` and could not fail. |
| `local_clone_does_not_borrow_objects` | the borrowing option held in a list one assignment away |
| `printed_remedy_runs_as_printed` | the image reference held in a constant |
| `signoff_report_states_its_stage` | `# TODO: we should write STA_BASIS here one day` |
| `generated_values_state_whether_they_were_read_or_defaulted` | `# we deliberately ignore matched_key / source / line here` |
| `provenance_value_is_resolved_not_constant` | the typed path held in a constant |
| `measurement_only_artefact_is_not_a_verdict_source` | the disclaimer nested one level down |
| `test_aggregate_carries_its_runtime_identity` | `{"image": "unknown", "interpreter": "n/a"}` |
| `declared_basis_matches_the_session_inputs` | a corpus where NOT ONE pair declares a stage — a vacuous pass |
| `only_the_declaring_step_writes_its_output` | a shell writer beside a Python one |
| `every_required_metric_key_has_a_producer` | (opposite direction) declared a WORKING axis unprovable, because producers build metric names by format and no literal scan can see them |

Two of these deserve to be read twice. A comment ADMITTING a defect certified it
away, in two separate gates — the defect certifying itself. And a runtime stamp
reading `"unknown"` passed the gate whose entire purpose is to make an aggregate
name its runtime: the absence of an identity wearing the shape of one, which is
this capture's own seam turned back on the instrument.

**None was findable by re-running verification**, because in every case the bug
WAS the pass, and verification looks for confirmation.

## The rule that generalises

`only_the_declaring_step_writes_its_output` documented its DATA-FLOW limit from
the start, and that limit was never mistaken for coverage. It did NOT document
its LANGUAGE limit, and that is precisely the one that bit.

> A gate's undisclosed boundary is the one that bites.

Every blind spot above lived in the gap between what a gate CHECKED and what it
CLAIMED — the same defect class as an artefact that cannot say what it measured,
one level up. All twelve now state their boundaries, and
`programs/tests/test_chip_path_rules_rc_contract.py` pins the family contract:
a crashing scan is rc=2 and says so, a bad invocation is rc=3, an empty
population is rc=2 with zero finding lines. It is proven able to fail.

## State at hand-off

* 216 tests across the thirteen test files; 97 across the ratchets a new program
  trips; D1 program-test-coverage PASS over 1250 programs; D2 PASS; shipped-path
  portability rc=0; 53 d9 tests pass with no pinned count disturbed.
* Sweeps over this repository: ten rc=0, one rc=2, one rc=1.
* On two real published run cells the twelve produce **zero** findings; the ones
  with nothing to say answer NOT CHECKED rather than PASS.

### What is NOT settled, and needs an owner

1. **Six flow-declared outputs have two independent writers.** Verified
   pair-by-pair by AST as genuinely independent, not delegation. Which write
   survives is execution order, so the same tree can grade either way. This is
   why `only_the_declaring_step_writes_its_output` exits 1 on this repository —
   a statement about the REPOSITORY, not about any run — and it must not be
   wired as a blocking gate until these are resolved.

   **One of the six needs no judgement.** Resolved against the declaring step's
   own `programs:` key, which is where the flow names a PRODUCER (gate clauses
   name VERIFIERS and must not be read as ownership):

   | declared output | step | flow-declared producer | verdict |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `reports/spare_cell_coverage.json` | 18 | `spare_cell_coverage_check` | **owner is declared**; `phase3_one_shot_runner` is the interloper |
   | `L21_POWER_INTENT.json` | D1 | — | flow declares no producer |
   | `eco_log.json` | 32 | — | flow declares no producer |
   | `no_eco_needed.flag` | 32 | — | flow declares no producer |
   | `extraction_coverage_report.json` | D1 | — | flow declares no producer |
   | `extraction_coverage_report.md` | D1 | — | flow declares no producer |

   So ONE has an unambiguous answer already written in the flow, and FIVE are
   declared by steps that name no producer at all — for those the flow cannot
   name an owner and a person must. That second fact is worth its own attention:
   an output the flow REQUIRES but for which it names nobody responsible is how
   two writers arrive in the first place.
2. **`clock_tree.rpt` is declared sign-off evidence and carries no stage stamp**,
   and the stamp has exactly two values. A report written after CTS and before
   routing can answer neither honestly. Closing it needs a third value in the
   stamp's vocabulary, not a stamp chosen at random. Disclosed on every run.
3. **The corpus-pointer contract split is untouched.** `_corpus_location` says
   the pointer replaces a MISSING corpus only; three consumers deliberately say
   the opposite. This lane enforces only the half both sides already do — the
   announcement — and pins that neutrality with a test.
