# tools/ci/repo_hygiene_gates.sh — the repo-wide invariant gates, in ONE place.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (vibe-ic#381 sweep)
# ----------------------------------------
# These gates were listed inline in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and were
# absent from `.github/workflows/gatekeeper-ci.yml`. That difference is not
# cosmetic: gatekeeper-ci is the ONLY workflow that fires on `merge_group`,
# so the native merge queue — the last thing that runs before a change
# lands — was executing a strictly WEAKER gate set than the PR check it
# supersedes. #394 had already found and hand-fixed one instance of exactly
# this (the merge gate carried only the message half of the NDA guard).
#
# A second hand-sync would drift again, because keeping two lists equal
# depends on remembering. One list invoked by both workflows makes the
# drift impossible instead of merely unlikely.
#
# WHAT BELONGS HERE: gates over repo-wide invariants that need no PR
# context. What does NOT: anything needing a commit RANGE or a base SHA
# (the NDA scanners, the version-monotonic and scope guards) — those are
# event-shaped and stay inline in the workflow that has the context.
